# timecrystals
Hi, this is an editor for a 2d platform game. The game is not mine, but it's by the smelly frog. I am making the editor and the smelly frog gave me the consent to do it, but he is not involved in the game editor. He made the game in 4 hours for a challenge. I am also making some changes to the game to adapt it to the editor and to change some behaviour of the gameplay.
